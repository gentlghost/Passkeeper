#### Why a remote password manager?
While using a built-in browser password manager is sufficient and secure for everyday use, it still relies on the internet to ensure that the user can still access their accounts. Since typically it uses whatever account is associated with developer of the browser (Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, etc.), malicious actors have one entry point to get the user's passwords. Therefore, if an actor cracks the account for the browser, they can access all of the user's account.

With a remote password manager, users do not need to worry about dependence on a browser manufacturer account and makes it harder for actors to access information. In order for an actor to gain access to the passwords, they need to access the device itself. However, if the device goes missing, then you lose the passwords. Also, unlike browser managers, there is no way to back up passwords via a server or the cloud, and it has to be backed up via storage. While a user gains the control over their passwords, they do lose the benefits of browser-based managers.
